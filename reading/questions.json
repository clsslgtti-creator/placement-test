    "title": "The Bus Ride",
    "passage": "Last Monday, I travelled by bus from Colombo to Galle. The journey had started early in the morning, and the bus was already crowded. While I was looking for a seat, I noticed a conductor who was busy  selling green tickets.\nRight now,  I am thinking about how noisy the ride was, but I must admit that it was also exciting. We don’t usually stop for tea, but that day the driver did. Tomorrow, I will leave Colombo early and take the train instead, because it might be faster and I might reach Galle before lunch.\nBy the end of next month, I will have completed several trips around Sri Lanka. Should I carry less luggage next time? Maybe I should. This time my arms really hurt carrying so much load.",
