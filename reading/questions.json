    "passage": "Last Monday, I travelled by bus from Colombo to Galle. The journey had started early in the morning, and the bus was already crowded. While I was looking for a seat, I noticed a conductor who was busy  selling green tickets.\nRight now,  I am thinking about how noisy the ride was, but I must admit that it was also exciting. We don’t usually stop for tea, but that day the driver did. Tomorrow, I will leave Colombo early and take the train instead, because it might be faster and I might reach Galle before lunch.\nBy the end of next month, I will have completed several trips around Sri Lanka. Should I carry less luggage next time? Maybe I should. This time my arms really hurt carrying so much load.",

Their father is making tea now, and the family are sitting together in the living room, listening to the rain beating on the roof. \nBy the afternoon, the rain will probably end, and Nisha has already arranged to meet her best friend arriving from Aluthgama outside the station.

At present, she can be seen pulling some stubborn ones from the soil. Yesterday, their mother enriched the ground with compost so that the plants would grow better. \nNext week, she intends to plant chillies, since they are frequently required for family meals. Last night, as Ravi watered vegetable beds, his father stood by the fence, chatting with a neighbour.
